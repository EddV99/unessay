                    <h2>What we see in fiction is happening in real life!</h2>
                    AI are usually depicted as being evil, all-knowing, as part
                    of a human (cyborg)servant, servent to humans, becoming
                    sentient, able to mimic humans, and so much more. Some of these things sound kind
                    of scary because it is. <br><br>

                    If you've read the book, "Catfishing on CatNet: A Novel" by
                    Naomi Kritzer, you would have seen an all-knowing AI
                    chatbot, that seemed to have access to any technology it
                    could connect to. In the Terminator series, the plot is about get chased
                    by a cyborg sent by an AI to kill them. In the move, I,
                    Robot, Sonny gains some kind of conscience. All these things
                    are stuff we can somewhat connect to the new advancements in
                    AI today.<br><br>
                   
                    Today, AI seems to advancing at an incredible pace! It seems
                    like every week you hear about something new AI is being
                    made to do. <br><br>

                    <h2>Why is AI commonly portrayed as evil?</h2>
                    One of my favorite science fiction plots is when you have
                    some kind of all-knowing, better than you in every way, evil AI
                    that somehowsomehow the main characters have to beat. <br><br>
                    But why is it so common? This is a hard question to give an
                    answer too, here are some thoughts.<br><br>
                    <ol> 
                        <li>Makes the fiction better!</li>
                        Often times we just want a good story and AI makes for
                        an interesting villain<br><br>
                        <li>Author has some personal worries of AI</li>
                        Maybe the author wants to tell the audience to start
                        worrying about the current state of AI.<br><br>
                        <li>They make money</li>
                        Making money is important for some authors and AI seems
                        to be attracting audiences.<br><br>
                        <li>They aren't always evil</li>
                        Sometimes they are just misunderstood, can't communicate
                        to humans effectively, or don't know what to do with
                        their new-found conscience.

                    Many arguments can be made to explain why an AI like in the
                    movies isn't possible. They use:

                <h2>An Idea for a game</h2>
                While playing the clicker game Universal Paperclips, it got me
                thinking of wanting to make an AI themed game. One of the major
                points that I wanted to make is how quickly AI has been thrown
                into our lives on how hard it might get to stop recognizing what
                was human made or generated by AI, so I wanted to make a
                "find-the-imposter" type game. <br><br> The game
                would be simple, in that all you would do is click stuff on the
                screen, but you would have to guess who/what is an AI from the
                moving characters. I envisioned many character designs,
                animations, and small details that would give the player a hint
                that they might actually be an AI character in this game world.
                <br><br>
                Drawing art, designing a world, and making the game takes a lot
                of time, so I've made a simple demo of what the
                game might play like.
