                    <h2>What we see in fiction is happening in real life!</h2>
                    Many AI in pictured in fiction is starting to to appear in
                    the actual world and people are just starting to notice. An example is from
                    the book, "Catfishing on CatNet: A Novel" by Naomi Kritzer. In that
                    book they have a fictional character that gains the ability to
                    think, like cats, and many other things. <br><br>

                    We have something similar today! It doesn't have a cool name like
                    CheShire Cat or have a conscious (yet), but it can do cool stuff
                    like generating a text response, images, videos, voice, and
                    the list keeps growing. <br><br>

                <h2>An Idea for a game</h2>
                While playing the clicker game Universial Paperclips, it got me
                thinking of wanting to make a AI themed game. One of the major
                points that I wanted to make is how quickly AI has been thrown
                into our lives on how hard it might get to stop recognizing what
                was human made or generated by AI, so I wanted to make a
                "find-the-imposter" type game. <br><br> The game
                would be simple, in that all you would do is click stuff on the
                screen, but you would have to guess who/what is an AI from the
                moving characters. I envisioned many character designs,
                animations, and small details that would give the player a hint
                that they might actually be an AI character in this game world.
                <br><br>
                Drawing art, designing a world, and making the game takes a lot
                of time, so I've made a simple demo of what the
                game might look like.
